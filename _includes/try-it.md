## Instructions

### Prerequisites

 * System with CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 18.04
 * Bare metal preferred, as we will be creating VMs to emulate bare metal hosts
 * Run as a user with passwordless sudo access

### Setup

tl;dr - Clone [metal3-dev-env](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-dev-env) and run `make`.

The `Makefile` runs a series of scripts, described here:

* `01_prepare_host.sh` - Installs all needed packages.

* `02_configure_host.sh` - Create a set of VMs that will be managed as if they
  were bare metal hosts. It also downloads some images needed for Ironic.

* `03_launch_mgmt_cluster.sh` - Launch a management cluster using `minikube` and
  run the `baremetal-operator` on that cluster.

* `04_verify.sh` - Runs a set of tests that verify that the deployment completed
  successfully

To tear down the environment, run `make clean`.

You can also run some tests provisioning and deprovisioning machines by running
`make test`


All configurations for the environment is stored in `config_${user}.sh`. You can
configure the following.

| Name | Option | Allowed values | Default |
|------|--------|----------------|---------|
| EXTERNAL_SUBNET | This is the subnet used on the "baremetal" libvirt network, created as the primary network interface for the virtual bare metalhosts. | <CIDR> | 192.168.111.0/24 |
| SSH_PUB_KEY | This SSH key will be automatically injected into the provisioned host by the provision_host.sh script. | <file path> | ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub |
| CONTAINER_RUNTIME | Select the Container Runtime | "podman", "docker" | "podman" |
| BMOREPO | Set the Baremetal Operator repository to clone | <URL> | https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator.git |
| BMOBRANCH  | Set the Baremetal Operator branch to checkout |  | master |
| CAPBMREPO | Set the Cluster Api baremetal provider repository to clone | <URL> | https://github.com/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-baremetal.git |
| CAPBMBRANCH  | Set the Cluster Api baremetal provider branch to checkout |  | master |
| FORCE_REPO_UPDATE | Force deletion of the BMO and CAPBM repositories before cloning them again | "true", "false" | "false" |
| BMO_RUN_LOCAL | Run a local baremetal operator instead of deploying in Kubernetes | "true", "false" | "false" |
| CAPBM_RUN_LOCAL | Run a local CAPI operator instead of deploying in Kubernetes    | "true", "false" | "false" |
| SKIP_RETRIES | Do not retry on failure during verifications or tests of the environment. This should be false. It could only be set to false for verifications of a dev env deployment that fully completed. Otherwise failures will appear as resources are not ready. | "true", "false" | "false" |
| TEST_TIME_INTERVAL | Interval between retries after verification or test failure (seconds) | <int> | 10 |
| TEST_MAX_TIME | Number of maximum verification or test retries | <int> | 120 |
| BMC_DRIVER | Set the BMC driver | "ipmi", "redfish" | "ipmi" |
| IMAGE_OS | OS of the image to boot the nodes from, overriden by IMAGE_* if set| "Cirros", "Ubuntu", "Centos" | "Cirros" |
| IMAGE_NAME | Image for target hosts deployment | | "cirros-0.4.0-x86_64-disk.img" |
| IMAGE_LOCATION | Location of the image to download | <URL> | http://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.4.0 |
| IMAGE_USERNAME | Image username for ssh | | "cirros" |
| IRONIC_IMAGE | Container image for local ironic services |  | "quay.io/metal3-io/ironic" |
| VBMC_IMAGE | Container image for vbmc container | | "quay.io/metal3-io/vbmc" |
| SUSHY_TOOLS_IMAGE | Container image for sushy-tools container | | "quay.io/metal3-io/sushy-tools" |
| CAPI_VERSION | Version of cluster API | "v1alpha1", "v1alpha2" | "v1alpha2" |

### Using a custom image

You can override the three following variables: `IMAGE_NAME`,
`IMAGE_LOCATION`, `IMAGE_USERNAME`. If a file with name `IMAGE_NAME` does not
exist in the folder `/opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic/html`, then it will be
downloaded from `IMAGE_LOCATION`.

### Note
If you see this error during the installation:

```sh
error: failed to connect to the hypervisor
error: Failed to connect socket to '/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock': Permission denied
```
You may need to log out then login again, and run `make` again.

## Working with the Environment

### Bare Metal Hosts

This environment creates a set of VMs to manage as if they were bare metal
hosts.  You can see the VMs using `virsh`.

```sh
$ sudo virsh list
 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------
 6     minikube                       running
 9     node_0                         running
 10    node_1                         running
```

Each of the VMs (aside from the `minikube` management cluster VM) are
represented by `BareMetalHost` objects in our management cluster.  The yaml
used to create these host objects is in `bmhosts_crs.yaml`.

```sh
$ kubectl get baremetalhosts -n metal3
NAME       STATUS    PROVISIONING STATUS   MACHINE   BMC                         HARDWARE PROFILE   ONLINE    ERROR
node-0     OK        ready                           ipmi://192.168.111.1:6230   unknown            true
node-1     OK        ready                           ipmi://192.168.111.1:6231   unknown            true
```

You can also look at the details of a host, including the hardware information
gathered by doing pre-deployment introspection.

```sh
$ kubectl get baremetalhost -n metal3 -oyaml node-0

### Provisioning a Machine

This section describes how to trigger provisioning of a host via `Machine`
objects as part of the `cluster-api` integration. This uses Cluster API V1alpha1
and assumes that metal3-dev-env was deployed with the environment variable
**CAPI_VERSION** set to **v1alpha1**.

First, run the `create_machine.sh` script to create a `Machine`.  The argument
is a name, and does not have any special meaning.

```sh
$ ./scripts/v1alpha1/create_machine.sh centos

secret/centos-user-data created
machine.cluster.k8s.io/centos created
```

At this point, the `Machine` actuator will respond and try to claim a
`BareMetalHost` for this `Machine`.  You can check the logs of the actuator
here:

```sh
$ kubectl logs -n metal3 pod/cluster-api-provider-baremetal-controller-manager-0 -c manager

{“level”:”info”,”ts”:1557509343.85325,”logger”:”baremetal-controller-manager”,”msg”:”Found API group metal3.io/v1alpha1”}
{“level”:”info”,”ts”:1557509344.0471826,”logger”:”kubebuilder.controller”,”msg”:”Starting EventSource”,”controller”:”machine-controller”,”source”:”kind source: /, Kind=”}
{“level”:”info”,”ts”:1557509344.14783,”logger”:”kubebuilder.controller”,”msg”:”Starting Controller”,”controller”:”machine-controller”}
{“level”:”info”,”ts”:1557509344.248105,”logger”:”kubebuilder.controller”,”msg”:”Starting workers”,”controller”:”machine-controller”,”worker count”:1}
2019/05/10 17:32:33 Checking if machine centos exists.
2019/05/10 17:32:33 Machine centos does not exist.
2019/05/10 17:32:33 Creating machine centos .
2019/05/10 17:32:33 2 hosts available
2019/05/10 17:32:33 Associating machine centos with host node-1
2019/05/10 17:32:33 Finished creating machine centos .
2019/05/10 17:32:33 Checking if machine centos exists.
2019/05/10 17:32:33 Machine centos exists.
2019/05/10 17:32:33 Updating machine centos .
2019/05/10 17:32:33 Finished updating machine centos .
```

If you look at the yaml representation of the `Machine`, you will see a new
annotation that identifies which `BareMetalHost` was chosen to satisfy this
`Machine` request.

```sh
$ kubectl get machine centos -n metal3 -o yaml

...
  annotations:
    metal3.io/BareMetalHost: metal3/node-1
...
```

You can also see in the list of `BareMetalHosts` that one of the hosts is now
provisioned and associated with a `Machine`.

```sh
$ kubectl get baremetalhosts -n metal3

NAME       STATUS    PROVISIONING STATUS   MACHINE   BMC                         HARDWARE PROFILE   ONLINE    ERROR
node-0     OK        ready                           ipmi://192.168.111.1:6230   unknown            true
node-1     OK        provisioning          centos    ipmi://192.168.111.1:6231   unknown            true
```

You should be able to ssh into your host once provisioning is complete.  See
the libvirt DHCP leases to find the IP address for the host that was
provisioned.  In this case, it’s `node-1`.

```sh
$ sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases baremetal

 Expiry Time          MAC address        Protocol  IP address                Hostname        Client ID or DUID
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2019-05-06 19:03:46  00:1c:cc:c6:29:39  ipv4      192.168.111.20/24         node-0          -
 2019-05-06 19:04:18  00:1c:cc:c6:29:3d  ipv4      192.168.111.21/24         node-1          -
```

The default user for the CentOS image is `centos`.

```sh
ssh centos@192.168.111.21
```

Deprovisioning is done just by deleting the `Machine` object.

```sh
$ kubectl delete machine centos -n metal3

machine.cluster.k8s.io "centos" deleted
```

At this point you can see that the `BareMetalHost` is going through a
deprovisioning process.

```sh
$ kubectl get baremetalhosts -n metal3

NAME       STATUS   PROVISIONING STATUS   MACHINE   BMC                         HARDWARE PROFILE   ONLINE   ERROR
node-0     OK       ready                           ipmi://192.168.111.1:6230   unknown            true
node-1     OK       deprovisioning                  ipmi://192.168.111.1:6231   unknown            false
```

### Provisioning a Cluster

The v1alpha2 deployment can be done with Ubuntu 18.04 or Centos 7 target host
images.

#### Requirements

##### Dev env size

The requirements for the dev env machine are, when deploying **Ubuntu** target
hosts:

* 16GB of memory
* 4 cpus

And when deploying **Centos** target hosts:

* 32GB of memory
* 4 cpus

The Minikube machine is deployed with 4GB of RAM, and 2 vCPUs, and the target
hosts with 4 vCPUs and either 4GB of RAM (Ubuntu) or 8GB of RAM (Centos).

#### Environment variables

The following environment variables need to be set for **Centos**:

```sh
export IMAGE_CHECKSUM=http://172.22.0.1/images/centos-updated.qcow2.md5sum
export IMAGE_NAME=centos-updated.qcow2
export CAPI_VERSION=v1alpha2
export IMAGE_URL=http://172.22.0.1/images/centos-updated.qcow2
export IMAGE_OS=Centos
export DEFAULT_HOSTS_MEMORY=8192
```

And the following environment variables need to be set for **Ubuntu**:

```sh
export CAPI_VERSION=v1alpha2
export IMAGE_OS=Ubuntu
export DEFAULT_HOSTS_MEMORY=4096
```

#### Deploy the metal3 Dev env

```sh
./01_prepare_host.sh
./02_configure_host.sh
./03_launch_mgmt_cluster.sh
```

#### Centos target hosts only, image update

If you want to deploy Ubuntu hosts, please skip to the next section.

If you want to deploy Centos 7 for the target hosts, the Centos 7 image requires
an update of Cloud-init. An updated image can be downloaded
[here](http://artifactory.nordix.org/artifactory/airship/images/centos.qcow2).
You can replace the existing centos image with the following commands :

```sh
curl -LO http://artifactory.nordix.org/artifactory/airship/images/centos.qcow2
mv centos.qcow2 /opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic/html/images/centos-updated.qcow2
md5sum /opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic/html/images/centos-updated.qcow2 | \
awk '{print $1}' > \
/opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic/html/images/centos-updated.qcow2.md5sum
```

#### Deploy the target cluster

```sh
./scripts/v1alpha2/create_cluster.sh
./scripts/v1alpha2/create_controlplane.sh
./scripts/v1alpha2/create_worker.sh
```

#### Delete the target cluster

```sh
kubectl delete cluster "${CLUSTER_NAME:-"test1"}" -n metal3
```

### Directly Provisioning Bare Metal Hosts

It’s also possible to provision via the `BareMetalHost` interface directly
without using the `cluster-api` integration.

There is a helper script available to trigger provisioning of one of these
hosts.  To provision a host with CentOS 7, run:

```sh
$ ./provision_host.sh node-0
```

The `BareMetalHost` will go through the provisioning process, and will
eventually reboot into the operating system we wrote to disk.

```sh
$ kubectl get baremetalhost node-0 -n metal3
NAME       STATUS   PROVISIONING STATUS   MACHINE   BMC                         HARDWARE PROFILE   ONLINE   ERROR
node-0   OK       provisioned                     ipmi://192.168.111.1:6230   unknown            true
```

`provision_host.sh` will inject your SSH public key into the VM. To find the IP
address, you can check the DHCP leases on the `baremetal` libvirt network.

```sh
$ sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases baremetal

 Expiry Time          MAC address        Protocol  IP address                Hostname        Client ID or DUID
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2019-05-06 19:03:46  00:1c:cc:c6:29:39  ipv4      192.168.111.20/24         node-0          -
 2019-05-06 19:04:18  00:1c:cc:c6:29:3d  ipv4      192.168.111.21/24         node-1          -
```

The default user for the CentOS image is `centos`.

```sh
ssh centos@192.168.111.20
```

There is another helper script to deprovision a host.

```sh
$ ./deprovision_host.sh node-0
```

You will then see the host go into a `deprovisioning` status:

```sh
$ kubectl get baremetalhost node-0 -n metal3
NAME       STATUS   PROVISIONING STATUS   MACHINE   BMC                         HARDWARE PROFILE   ONLINE   ERROR
node-0   OK       deprovisioning                  ipmi://192.168.111.1:6230   unknown            true
```

### Running a Custom baremetal-operator

The `baremetal-operator` comes up running in the cluster by default, using an
image built from the `metal3-io/baremetal-operator` github repository.  If
you’d like to test changes to the `baremetal-operator`, you can follow this
process.

First, you must scale down the deployment of the `baremetal-operator` running
in the cluster.

```sh
kubectl scale deployment metal3-baremetal-operator -n metal3 --replicas=0
```

To be able to run `baremetal-operator` locally, you need to install `operator-sdk` https://github.com/operator-framework. After that, you can run the `baremetal-operator` including any custom changes.

```sh
cd ~/go/src/github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator
make run
```

### Running a Custom cluster-api-provider-baremetal

There are two cluster-api related managers running in the cluster.  One
includes set of generic controllers, and the other includes a custom Machine
controller for baremetal.  If you want to try changes to
`cluster-api-provider-baremetal`, you want to shut down the custom Machine
controller manager first.

```sh
$ kubectl scale statefulset cluster-api-provider-baremetal-controller-manager -n metal3 --replicas=0
```

Then you can run the custom Machine controller manager out of your local git tree.

```sh
cd ~/go/src/github.com/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-baremetal
make run
```

### Accessing the Ironic API

Sometimes you may want to look directly at Ironic to debug something.
The metal3-dev-env repository contains a clouds.yaml file with
connection settings for Ironic.

metal3-dev-env will install the openstack command line tool on the
provisioning host as part of setting up the cluster. The openstack tool
will look for clouds.yaml in the current directory or you can copy it to
~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml. Version 3.19.0 or higher is needed to
interact with Ironic using clouds.yaml.


Example:

```sh
[notstack@metal3 metal3-dev-env]$ export OS_CLOUD=metal3
[notstack@metal3 metal3-dev-env]$ openstack baremetal node list
+--------------------------------------+--------+---------------+-------------+--------------------+-------------+
| UUID                                 | Name   | Instance UUID | Power State | Provisioning State | Maintenance |
+--------------------------------------+--------+---------------+-------------+--------------------+-------------+
| 882cf206-d688-43fa-bf4c-3282fcb00b12 | node-0 | None          | None        | enroll             | False       |
| ac257479-d6c6-47c1-a649-64a88e6ff312 | node-1 | None          | None        | enroll             | False       |
+--------------------------------------+--------+---------------+-------------+--------------------+-------------+
```

To view a particular node's details, run the below command. The
`last_error`, `maintenance_reason`, and `provisioning_state` fields are
useful for troubleshooting to find out why a node did not deploy.

```sh
[notstack@metal3 metal3-dev-env]$ export OS_CLOUD=metal3
[notstack@metal3 metal3-dev-env]$ openstack baremetal node show 882cf206-d688-43fa-bf4c-3282fcb00b12
